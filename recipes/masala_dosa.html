	<h2> Description : </h2>
	<p>
		Masala dosa are crispy, soft, savory and <em>healthy</em> crepes made with a rice and lentil batter. The dosa
		are gluten-free and dairy-free, with a sturdy yet soft texture that's great for holding a hearty homemade potato
		filling. To make the batter, lentils and rice are soaked for several hours and then blended together.
	</p>

	<p>
		Dosa is high in carbohydrates and contains no added sugars or saturated fats. As its key ingredients are rice
		and black gram, it is a good source of protein. A typical homemade plain dosa without oil contains about 112
		calories,<u> of which 84% is carbohydrate and 16% protein.</u>
	</p>

	<p> Another tale narrates that it was one of the kings of Mysore, Someshvara III, who was the inventor of the masala
		dosa. The king had hosted an extravagant party that served a lot of food to his guests. However, once the party
		had come to an end, the king noticed that there were a lot of food left behind. Since he didn't want the food to
		go to waste, he called in his team of cooks to come up with something creative. The cooks set out to work by
		combining leftover potatoes with spices and then used as a filling for the plain dosa. However, the cooks would
		add a layer of spicy red chutney beneath the spiced potatoes and then fold the crepe and serve it with a side of
		plain coconut chutney.</p>

			ferment for 8-10 hours or overnight, allowing it to rise and develop a tangy flavor.</li>
		<li> For the potato masala filling, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan. Add 1 teaspoon of mustard seeds and let
			them splutter. Then, add 1/2 teaspoon of cumin seeds, a pinch of asafoetida (hing), and a few curry leaves.

			ingredients and cook for another 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and set the potato masala aside.</li>
		<li> Heat a non-stick or cast-iron skillet on medium heat. Grease it lightly with oil.</li>
		<li> Take a ladleful of the dosa batter and pour it onto the center of the skillet. Using the back of the ladle,
			spread the batter in a circular motion to form a thin, round dosa.</li>
		<li> Drizzle a teaspoon of oil around the edges of the dosa and a little over the top. Cook until the bottom
			turns golden brown and crispy.</li>
		<li> Spoon a generous amount of the potato masala filling onto one side of the dosa. Fold the other side over
			the filling to form a semi-circle or roll it up into a cylinder</li>
