	<h3> Ingredients : </h3>
	<ul>
		<li> Rice: The main component, usually parboiled or idli rice, provides the base for the idli batter. </li>
		<li> Urad Dal (Split Black Lentils): Adds a rich flavor and helps in the fermentation process. </li>
		<li> Fenugreek Seeds: These tiny seeds enhance the fermentation process and contribute to the idli's texture.
		</li>
		<li> Salt: Enhances the taste and balances the flavors. </li>
		<li> Water: Used for soaking the rice and lentils and for grinding the batter. </li>
	</ul>

	<h3> And finally the steps to prepare this : </h3>
	<ol>
		<li> Soaking: Wash and soak 2 cups of rice and 1 cup of urad dal along with a teaspoon of fenugreek seeds in
			separate bowls. Soak them for at least 4-6 hours or overnight. </li>
		<li> Grinding: Drain the water from both the rice and urad dal. Grind the urad dal and fenugreek seeds together
			in a wet grinder or a food processor until you get a smooth and fluffy batter. Transfer it to a large bowl.
			Next, grind the rice with a little water until it becomes a fine paste. Mix the rice batter with the urad
			dal batter, add salt, and blend well. The batter should be of pouring consistency. </li>
		<li> Fermentation: Cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap and leave it in a warm place for fermentation. Let
			it ferment for about 8-10 hours or overnight. The batter will rise and double in volume. </li>
		<li> Steaming: Grease the Thatte Idli plates (large, round, flat plates with small depressions) with a little
			oil. Pour a ladleful of batter into each depression, filling it to the brim. Place the plates in a steamer
			and steam for about 10-12 minutes until the idlis are cooked and firm. Insert a toothpick or a knife into an
			idli to check if it comes out clean. </li>
		<li> Serving: Once the idlis are cooked, remove them from the steamer and let them cool for a minute. Gently
			loosen the edges of the idlis with a spoon and remove them from the plates. Serve hot with sambar, chutney,
			or your favorite accompaniments. </li>
