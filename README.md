# odin-recipies

This would be my first Odin Project (Haha), although not flashy and cool,
I still am very much liking whatever basics being drilled so far.

So, since this is a project on recipes (damn I always get the spelling wrong)
I will go for the traditional food in India, especially from my native 
--Mysuru, Karnataka.

That may include:

1. Set Masala Dose
     -- The mouth watering crunchy bf 
3. Bisi Bele Bath
     -- (which apparantely seems to have originated in palace and 
took 100 years to come out of royalty :O )
4. Thatte Idli
     -- the soft melting-in-the-mouth sexy stuff.
